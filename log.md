**:first_quarter_moon: Day 3**
I decided to log my progress in log.md so when I look back at this goal, I can better appreciate my progress and hopefully have some insight for future projects.

:package: Modules: socket, nmap

Following along freeCodeCamp's Python for Pen Testing module.
tcp-client.py and tcp-server.py creates a TCP server and client, establishes a brief connection, and send & receive a message using socket module.


**:waxing_gibbous_moon: Day 4**
Building out the nmap scanner and completing freeCodeCamp's Developing an Nmap Scanner.

**Day 5 & 6**
Days off

**:full_moon: Day 7**
Created a banner grabber script based on freeCodeCamp's Developing a Banner Grabber.

Looking into data analysis with Python (freeCodeCamp) with the goal of capturing trends or patterns to better inform decision making.
:books: Libraries: pandas, numPy

**:waning_gibbous_moon: Day 8**
Pandas module = one of the most popular python libraries for data analysis, which sits on top of numPy.
Series are ordered dictionaries.
read_csv, powerful function from pandas --> import data into pandas workflow
use loc to get particular value from row.

**:last_quarter_moon: Day 9**
Starting data cleaning with python on freeCodeCamp.
Handling missing data with Pandas: identify null values or invalid values
...felt that these video tutorials are not that hands on so moving onto another endeavor.

Looking into Al Sweigart's Udemy course for Automating the Boring Stuff to review python basics.
Review:
- IDLE is an editor included in python installation
- every variable has exactly one data type (unlike C++ you don't need to declare what the data type is in python)
- Boolean values: True, False
- Boolean operators: and, or, not
- if you don't designate a return value in a function, the default return value is None.

Created a very simple hello.py script that says hi and asks user for their name.

:package: Modules
pyperclip # contains copy() and paste() to copy/paste to clipboard, useful for copying/pasting large amounts of text from program

:snake: next: write guess the number game using random module.
