**Day 3**
I decided to log my progress in log.md so when I look back at this goal, I can better appreciate my progress and hopefully have some insight for future projects.

Modules: socket, nmap

Following along freeCodeCamp's Python for Pen Testing module.
tcp-client.py and tcp-server.py creates a TCP server and client, establishes a brief connection, and send & receive a message using socket module.


**Day 4**
Building out the nmap scanner and completing freeCodeCamp's Developing an Nmap Scanner.
