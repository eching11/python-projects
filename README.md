# python-projects

**Goal**
During the first 100 days of 2021, I want to improve my skills with Python by creating and developing a mix of programs that I'll use or thought might be fun to work on.

**Some background**
I've learned on my own how to automate tasks with Python for work but I want to learn how to build more complex programs, eventually building a functional web application that's accessible, maybe even helpful to someone. Or how I can use Python to automate vulnerability scans/analysis.

Things I (re)learn along the way will go into log.md.
